    "From 2012 to 2018, the ACT's popularity exceeeded that of the SAT and it was only until 2019 that SAT managed to turn the tide with 55% of the market share. As an employee of the College board (the organisation that administers the SAT), this projects seeks to: (i) identify trends between SAT and ACT (based on data from 2017 to 2019) and (ii) examine if income affects the participation rates of SAT and ACT. With the relevant findings, we can then suggest possible actions to help non-technical executives of the Board maintain SAT's competitve edge over ACT (i.e. higher participation rate)."

    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, SAT and ACT have been close substitutes for each other for many years. Up until 2012, the SAT's popularity exceeeded that of the ACT - it was 55% versus 45% in market share terms. However, as the perception that colleges had a preference for SAT over ACT waned, ACT began eroding SAT's market share. In 2012, the ACT overtook SAT in market share. This was in part due to many states adopting the ACT as their official state test for juniors ([*source*](https://theolivebook.com/sat-vs-act-which-is-more-popular/#:~:text=As%20of%202019%2C%20the%20SAT,students%20who%20took%20the%20ACT.)).\n",

The important question before the College Board (the organisation that administers the SAT) is then to devise strategies to maintain its competitive edge over ACT."

For instance, the cost to take the SAT during the 2018-2019 school year was 47.50 dollars for the basic test and 64.50 dollars to take the test with the full essay section. Before a student can take an SAT subject test, he/she must also pay a 26 dollars registration fee, 22 dollars for each additional test and 26 dollars for each language test [(*source*](https://blog.collegeboard.org/how-much-does-sat-cost)).\n",

    "        - Which colleges have the highest median SAT and ACT scores for admittance?\n",
    "        - Which California school districts have the highest and lowest mean test scores?\n",
    "    - **You should comment on your findings at each step in a markdown cell below your code block**. Make sure you include at least one example of sorting your dataframe by a column, and one example of using boolean filtering (i.e., masking) to select a subset of the dataframe."

    "## Visualize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There's not a magic bullet recommendation for the right number of plots to understand a given dataset, but visualizing your data is *always* a good idea. Not only does it allow you to quickly convey your findings (even if you have a non-technical audience), it will often reveal trends in your data that escaped you when you were looking only at numbers. It is important to not only create visualizations, but to **interpret your visualizations** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every plot should**:\n",
    "- Have a title\n",
    "- Have axis labels\n",
    "- Have appropriate tick labels\n",
    "- Text is legible in a plot\n",
    "- Plots demonstrate meaningful and valid relationships\n",
    "- Have an interpretation to aid understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what your plots should look like following the above guidelines. Note that while the content of this example is unrelated, the principles of visualization hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://snag.gy/hCBR1U.jpg)\n",
    "*Interpretation: The above image shows that as we increase our spending on advertising, our sales numbers also tend to increase. There is a positive correlation between advertising spending and sales.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."

    "**Observations based on above heatmap**  \n",
    "The heatmap above suggests the following: \n",
    "1. Negative correlation between scores and participation rates. For instance, the correlation between SAT participation and average total score was -0.87, -0.79 and -0.86 for 2017 to 2019 respectively. Similarly, for ACT, the correlation between participation and average composite score was -0.86, -0.86 and -0.87 for 2017 to 2019 respectively. This means that higher participation rate actually leads to lower scores. Conversely, low participation rates suggests better scores due to potential selection bias in which only the most motivated students would take the tests and do well in them.\n",
    "2. Correlation between participation rates for SAT and ACT are highly negative (-0.84 for 2017 and -0.87 for 2018 and 2019). This suggests that states with higher SAT participation rates tend to have a lower ACT participation rate, vice versa.\n",
    "3. Correlation between incomes (either median household income or per capita income) and scores is positive for SAT but negative for ACT. For instance, correlation between median household income with: (i) sat_2018_part is 0.52; and (ii) act_2018_part is -0.53. This suggests that as a state gets richer, it tends to participate more in SAT and less in ACT.  "

    "Histograms of participation rates from 2017-2019 illustrate the changes over the years and suggest a bimodal tendency in which states either have very high or low participation rates. For SAT, it has  fewer states with 100% participation rates and more states with low participation rates (> 15 states with zero participation). On the contrary, ACT has > 15 states with 100% participation rates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the histograms above, we do not observe that the samples are normally distributed. For us to invoke the Central Limit Theorem, we would need a sample size of  n > 30 (i.e. drawing the participation rates from each state for each year > 30 times). Without the assumption of a normal distribution, we cannot assume that the datapoints are symmetric around its mean.  "

    "From 2012 to 2018, the ACT's popularity exceeeded that of the SAT and it was only until 2019 that SAT managed to turn the tide with 55% of the market share. As an employee of the College board (the organisation that administers the SAT), this projects seeks to: (i) identify trends between SAT and ACT (based on data from 2017 to 2019) and (ii) examine if income affects the participation rates of SAT and ACT. With the relevant findings, we can then suggest possible actions to help non-technical executives of the Board maintain SAT's competitve edge over ACT (i.e. higher participation rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identified trends between SAT and ACT**  \n",
    "1. Studying of SAT/ACT data from 2017-2019 and income data reviews a negative correlation between test scores and participation rates. As more students participate in a test, the lower its average scores become. This could be due to the selection bias problem, in which only the most motivated and well-prepared students did well for their tests (and hence low participation rates). As such, if the College Board decides to solely increase participation rates, it would mean that a majority of juniors would not be performing very well for their tests.\n",
    "2. Negative correlation between participation rates for SAT and ACT. This could mean that students see both tests as close substitutes, suggesting that states with higher SAT participation rates tend to have a lower ACT participation rate, vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identified trends between SAT/ACT and income** \n",
    "1. Positive correlation between SAT participation rates and income, negative correlation for ACT. This suggests that as a state gets richer, it tends to participate more in SAT and less in ACT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**  \n",
    "To maintian SAT's competitive edge over ACT and to increase its participation rate, we propose that:\n",
    "1. The College Board focuses its attention on wooing high-income states to take part in SAT; and\n",
    "2. Once these high-income states come onboard, to place more emphasis on creating and providing better preparatory materials so as to minimise the chances of observing lower average scores down the road."
